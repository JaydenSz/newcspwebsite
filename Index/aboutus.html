He juggles many things on his plate between Mock Trial, AP Bio, Book club, and somehow is still not able to hang out with friends. But out of all the classes and extracurricular activities he is taking AP CSP is his favorite because “The fact that we get to manage ourselves”. He knows Python and HTML. His hobbies are sleeping, video games, chess, sleeping, books, science, and did I mention sleeping. He has no choice on which college he wants to go to because Yash forced him to go to UCLA.
